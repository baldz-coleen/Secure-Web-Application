# Secure Web Application - Project Summary

We built a **secure web application** where users can register, log in, and access different pages based on their role (regular user or admin). It's like a mini version of websites that require accounts, such as social media or admin panels.

For the Main Features:

1. User Registration & Login
- Users can create an account with email and password
- Users can log in with their credentials
- Passwords are securely stored (hashed, never stored as plain text)
- Password strength meter shows if password is strong enough

2. Role-Based Access Control
- Two types of users: **regular users** and **admins**
- Regular users can access the dashboard
- Only admins can access the admin panel
- If you try to access a page you're not allowed to see, you get redirected

3. Security Features
- **Password hashing**: Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt (industry standard)
- **SQL injection protection**: Database queries use safe methods
- **XSS protection**: User input is sanitized to prevent malicious code
- **Session management**: Secure cookies keep you logged in
- **Input validation**: Forms check for valid email and strong passwords

4. User Interface
- Clean, modern design
- Password visibility toggle (show/hide password)
- Error messages when something goes wrong
- Loading states when submitting forms


## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14** - React framework for building the website
- **MySQL** - Database to store user information
- **bcrypt** - Library to hash passwords securely
- **iron-session** - Library to manage secure sessions
- **Zod** - Library to validate form inputs
- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces

## How It Works

Registration Process
1. User fills out registration form (email, password, confirm password)
2. System checks if password is strong enough
3. System checks if email already exists
4. Password gets hashed (encrypted)
5. User account is created in database
6. User is automatically logged in
7. User is redirected to dashboard

Login Process
1. User enters email and password
2. System finds user in database
3. System compares entered password with stored hash
4. If correct, creates a session cookie
5. User is redirected to dashboard

Protected Pages
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): Any logged-in user can access
- **Admin Panel** (`/admin`): Only admins can access
- If you're not logged in, you get redirected to login page
- If you're not an admin but try to access admin panel, you get redirected to dashboard

## Security Measures Implemented

1. **Password Security**
   - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
   - Only password hashes are stored, never plain passwords
   - Strong password requirements enforced

2. **Session Security**
   - Sessions are encrypted
   - Cookies are HttpOnly (can't be accessed by JavaScript)
   - Sessions expire after 7 days

3. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - All database queries use parameterized queries
   - User input is never directly inserted into SQL

4. **XSS Prevention**
   - User input is escaped before displaying
   - Prevents malicious scripts from running

5. **Route Protection**
   - Middleware checks if user is logged in
   - Layouts check user roles before allowing access


## Database

**Users Table:**
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `email` - User's email (unique)
- `password_hash` - Encrypted password
- `role` - Either "user" or "admin"
- `created_at` - When account was created
